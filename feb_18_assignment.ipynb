        "API stands for \"Application Programming Interface.\" It is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. Essentially, an API defines how different software components should interact with each other. APIs allow developers to access the functionality of a particular application or service and use it in their own software applications.\n",

For example, many websites use the Google Maps API to display a map of their business location, provide directions to customers, or show the location of nearby restaurants or other points of interest. The Google Maps API allows developers to access a range of features, including geocoding (converting addresses to geographic coordinates), routing (finding the best route between two locations), and displaying custom markers and overlays on the map."
