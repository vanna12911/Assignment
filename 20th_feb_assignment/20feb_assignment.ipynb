    "<b>GET</b>:   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) Get method is mainly used at the client (Browser) side to send a request to a specified server to get certain data or resources. Using this method the server should only let us receive the data and not change its state. Hence it is only used to view something and not to change it. Get method is one of the most used HTTP method. The request parameter of the get method is appended to the URL. Get request is better for the data which does not need to be secure (It means the data which does not contain images or word documents).\n",

    "<b>POST</b>:  he Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) Post method is mainly used at the client (Browser) side to send data to a Specified server in order to create or rewrite a particular resource/data. This data sent to the server is stored in the request body of the HTTP request. Post method eventually leads to the creation of a new resource or updating an existing one. Due to this dynamic use, it is one of the most used HTTP methods. It is not one of the most secure methods because the data that is been sent is included in the body of the request and not in the URL. Post request is better for the data which needs to be secure (It means the data which contains images or word documents)"
